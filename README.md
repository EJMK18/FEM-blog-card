### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- I have learnt how to create custom pointer cursors. Cursors are not stylable. Therefore, the url value should be used with the cursor property within the CSS stylesheet. The url value should point to the location of the custom cursor. Image files can be used in this regard.

```css
h1:hover,
h1:active {
	color: var(--primary-colour);
	cursor: url(pointer-black-hand.png), pointer;
}
```
